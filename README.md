# Motion-detection-using-OpenCV

This project implements real-time motion detection using OpenCV. It captures frames from a video feed, detects motion by comparing consecutive frames, and highlights moving objects.

## Features
- Detects motion in real-time using OpenCV
- Highlights moving objects with bounding boxes
- Supports webcam and video file input
- Adjustable sensitivity for motion detection
